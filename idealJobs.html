            <p>With all of these roles being specialised roles within the IT industry, there are undoubtly similarities
                between all of them such as being proefficient with computers and having a general understanding of each
                other roles. The Azure System Administrator roles and System Administrator roles are the most similar,
                however the Azure administrator is just more specialised. The security roles are also similar, however
                one provides analysis and the other designs solutions. The Director of IT role is the most broad and
                probably prestigious of the mix, requiring a strong enough knowledge of the overall industry to be able
                to make informed decisions on administrator, security, and development. The .NET developer requires all
                of the same problem solving skills as any other developer would, but they require specific knowledge on
                the .NET framework and syntax.</p>
