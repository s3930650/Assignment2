        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Insignia Collection is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software suite for businesses of all
                sizes, across all industries. The suite will encompass a wide range of applications and provided as
                single applications or bundled together for a discount, with an affordable monthly fee. The applications
                are designed with modularity and expansion in mind, so as a business grows, they can extend their
                subscription to include other applications that will work straight out of the box. This will work by
                utilising cloud services such as data storage, so that all of the applications will use the same methods
                to read and write data. When the data is updated, there will be a service layer that can notify the
                other applications that are running so the data is always live. Applications will be installed locally,
                however as data and subscription will be cloud based an internet connection will be required.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Enterprise resource planning software has been in use since the 1990s and is a common occurrence in
                successful businesses around the globe, with 50% of companies acquiring or upgrading their ERP systems
                in the near future and 37% of ERP systems implemented requiring significant customization, there is a
                clear opening in the market for an ERP system that isn’t a hassle to set up or maintain (Biel 2022).
                There are some products that offer a comprehensive suite to reduce these pains, however they usually
                bring the pain of expensive monthly pricing as well as functionality that is irrelevant to many users
                (Apagen Solutions 2020). The Insignia Collection is designed to eliminate these pains with an easy to
                use, modular system, with an affordable price point. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Business Case</h2>
            <p>
                As stated in the Motivation section, Insignia believe that there is a gap for an integrated application
                suite that incorporates machine learning. Our internal analysis has estimated a revenue stream for the
                proposed product to be profitable. We have determined that the initial offering will achieve enough
                revenue for the continuing development and support of the product, in addition to having enough surplus
                to grow the various teams associated with a software corporation. Initial planning and development of
                the product will require fund raising among venture capitalists.
                We would propose all members be present for presentations among Australian and possibly foreign
                investors. The Insignia team have assessed a development time of 2 years to reach minimum viable product
                (MVP). The fund has to pay salaries for the partners within Insignia, the capital expenditure, which
                includes computer, networking and storage equipment. As well as operating expenses such as rent,
                utilities and cloud services.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <i style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">The Service</i>
            <p>The Insignia Collection is an ERP software suite, offering businesses of all sizes a wide range of
                applications that are can be fully integrated with each other without the need for overcomplicated
                setup. This is Software as a Service, and will require a monthly or annual subscription. Due to the aim
                of modularity and affordability, customers are able to purchase subscriptions for individual products or
                bundles of applications, or the entire collection.
                <br /><br />
                When a customer purchases their first application subscription, an environment for their data will be
                created. With this environment, all of the applications in the suite will be able to interface with each
                as a web hook on the databases will notify the applications whenever relevant information has been
                updated. After the first purchase, a portal will be available online providing the customer an admin
                portal, providing a dashboard with information about their services and their business information. The
                customer will be able to add their own employees through this platform, allowing them to self-manage who
                has access to their applications, and even who has access to certain functionality within the
                applications.
            </p>
            <i style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">The Applications</i>
            <p>The following applications are what we would like to offer when we launch. Whilst there are definitely
                more applications we would like to make, we believe that as our company and userbase grows we will be
                able to take on user feedback as well as market trends and gaps in the market to make additions to our
                collection as we see fit.</p>
            <p><u>Human Resources</u><br />
                The human resources (HR) application will enable the customer to manage their employees and processes.
                The software will be able to create new employees, as well as modify and remove existing ones. When an
                employee is created, they can be assigned a role which gives them access to other applications, or they
                can be given permissions to individual software. If the customer has purchased other parts of the
                collection like payroll and an email service, a payroll number and new company email address can be
                created at the same time allowing a ‘one click’ solution. The HR application will be capable of drafting
                contracts and policies, and it will also enable the employees of our customers to submit HR complaints
                or feedback anonymously.
            </p>
            <p><u>Inventory Management</u><br />
                The inventory software will enable the business to keep track of goods and materials that are used
                within the business. It will primarily feature a purchasing and receiving system, so purchase orders can
                be made and when stock is received it will have accurate costings per item. When an item has been
                received, the user responsible for receiving it can be logged for accountability, and if the account
                software has been purchased the invoice can lodged automatically. It will also feature an item location
                system, so goods can be physically located so everything has its place. For customers like engineers or
                manufacturers who use the system to manage components required to make their products, a part list can
                be created showing the cost of each item as well as their availability so they’re able to easily see if
                they’re have enough material to keep producing goods
            </p>
            <p><u>Point of Sale</u><br />
                The point of sale (POS) application will be able to interface with the inventory system, as well as the
                accounting system and the customer relations management system. Interfacing with the inventory system
                means that as stock is sold, it will automatically update the quantities showing in the system, and also
                provide a way for staff to query where stock is and what the sell price is. Having the accounting system
                will enable the customer to balance their sales journal with their accounts, and make it easier to
                manage things like GST holding. For online stores, or general account-based sales, customers will be
                able to have their orders logged against their account so that a record can be checked in the CRM.
            </p>
            <p><u>Customer Relations Management</u><br />
                The customer relations management (CRM) application gives customers the ability to keep track of their
                customers and their details. With the CRM application, online stores can interface with the database to
                have their customers register directly into the environment. This eliminates the need of technical
                developer work on their website, as well as making customer data collection (order history, cart
                history, notification preferences, and general user data) an automated process. For stores that aren’t
                online, or even hybrid stores, these functionalities will still be there, but the option to manually add
                and maintain customer details is there too. Whilst online customers make it easy to get the customer
                info, there is also extra features like notes and logs that can be stored for internal use only.
            </p>
            <p><u>Payroll</u><br />
                The payroll application will enable the customers employees to view their schedules, request leave, and
                view their payslips. The payroll administrator will be able to set these schedules, approve the leave,
                and lodge the payslips. When the schedule is set, the accounting software will be updated with a payroll
                budget, and when a payslip is generated, or leave is approved, it will make sure that the relevant
                accounting column is updated. As a standalone application, this information can be exported as either a
                CSV file or Excel workbook so that it can be forwarded into another system or even to external accounts.
            </p>
            <p><u>Accounting</u><br />
                The accounting software will enable the customer to create budgets, see cash flow, track tax, as well as
                enter payments and expenses. It will interface with most of the other applications, generating invoices
                at the point of sale, lodging invoices when goods are received in the inventory system, as well as
                paying staff via the payroll system. If the customer is using alternative software, the accounting
                software will accept uploads of external files like CSV files so that they can be processed as well.

            <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
            <p>As of June 2022 76% of business use computers running Microsoft Windows, while only 14% use MacOS
                (Statista 2022b). Based off this information it would make sense for Insignia to focus on programming
                the application suite for Windows users for our initial launch and review adding support for MacOS at a
                later date as demand increases. Coding these applications in C# would give us a great edge, as it is a
                strong object orientated programming language created by Microsoft themselves for their .NET Framework
                (Microsoft 2022b). Not only is it incredibly strong for desktop development, it is also able to be used
                in web development making code highly transferrable. With growth in mind, we are able to use a single C#
                codebase to target the Mac audience as well as making mobile apps to keep the suite accessible wherever
                it is needed (Microsoft 2022c). We will be able to use Microsoft Visual Studio as our IDE software to do
                all of these things, as well as utilise software like Git to maintain clean version control.
                <br /><br />
                For hardware and infrastructure we would utilise the power of Microsoft Azure as it will integrate well
                with our development setup. They are able to provide us with necessary storage and server requirements
                to deploy our application suite. This service offers us the ability to easily scale our compute or
                storage requirements both vertically and horizontally so that we can maintain performance and
                reliability through any increase in demand we may have (Microsoft 2022d).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>
                A project such as this will require many skills, both IT specific and general. Specifically will need
                people who have a sound understanding in business, Azure, programming, data, and cybersecurity.
                <br /><br />
                The people on our team who understand business will be able to help direct the development team on the
                applications, providing insightful information that will enrich the experience for our end users.
                <br /><br />
                Since the system will be hosted on the Azure platform, we will need people with the technical knowledge
                of the platform or people who have experience with similar platforms with transferrable knowledge.
                <br /><br />
                As the .NET framework is the core of the product, we will need developers who are very experience with
                it so that our code can be as efficient and reliable as possible. We will also need developers with
                frontend experience (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) for our web related services.
                <br /><br />
                Since each customer will have their own database environment with tables relevant to their purchased
                products, we need people who have strong skills in building schemas and queries that will enable these
                databases be configured automatically, removing the hassle from the customers.
                <br /><br />
                Finally, with the data of our customers, their business, and their customers, we need our applications
                and servers to be secure. Cybersecurity is a priority we can not afford to neglect, so we will need
                experts that are able to continuously find any potential exploits or vulnerabilities and notify our
                developers to patch.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>Ideally the outcome for the Insignia Collection is a strong suite of applications used throughout all
                sectors, from small businesses to enterprise businesses. Joseph Foley from Creative Bloq (2022) and
                Anisha Singh from Pixpa (2022) both rate software from the creative suite of applications from Adobe,
                Adobe Creative Cloud, as the number one application in graphic design whilst also giving praise to
                Adobe’s other applications. With our premium product offering, our no hassle configuration, and our
                instant integration solutions, we aim that the Insignia Collection sits atop of the metaphorical ERP
                software throne. However just as Adobe dominates the market, it also decimates the wallet, which has
                inspired piracy (The Piracy Years 2011) and knock off products. We aim to offer our collection at a
                price point that drastically reduces the motivation to look for alternatives, and then also provide a
                service that is so stable and consistent the alternatives won’t even measure up. </p>
