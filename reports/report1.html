            <h3>An Introduction</h3>
            <div class="report-content">

                    <p> <span class="subheading">What is a Cloud? What is a service? What is a server?</span><br/>
                        A cloud is generally a service that is most commonly provided via a connection to the internet or alternatively, a private network.
                        The actual apparatus that is providing a cloud, is located on one or more servers in a location somewhere in the world and is generally accessible from anywhere in the world. 
                        There are many multiple providers of cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google, Dropbox etc.
                        And multiple products available from the cloud, such as Netflix, Financial services, Office 365, RMIT Online Education and many more.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="subheading">What can this service be?</span><br/>
                        It is the serving of information - of data transmitted to your device for you to read – on your Kindle, or to watch – on myriad platforms such as Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime et al. 
                        You can listen from a cloud service – with music services such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music etc. 
                        You can learn – whether it be the RMIT Online Education platform, languages via Rosetta Stone, watching YouTube videos etc. 
                        This service though, need not just be the transmission of data. 
                        It can also be analysis services, machine learning and calculations of large amounts of data – also called big data.
                        The cloud facilitates the increased use of insightful data analysis across almost every industry.  
                        An example is the medical data analysed from millions of treatments that is used to improve medical outcomes. 
                        Another example of the cloud providing extreme processing capability, leveraging the large processing power of the cloud, is for scientific pursuits. 
                        One such pursuit was a Google research team that used the Google Cloud to calculate Pi to 100,000,000,000,000 digits. Even with the cloud processing capability of Google, it still took almost 158 days to complete. And it required the use of 515 terabytes of storage.                    
                    </p>  
                    <p><span class="subheading">What is a server?</span><br/>
                        A server is the smallest unit, and most akin to a physical unit, of the three paradigms within the cloud.
                        A server can be defined as the compute component housed within 1 physical shell. It can also be used as a generic label of the unit that provides the capability to ‘serve’.
                        Servers itself is not a unit like a meter, that is universally the same. Servers can be all sorts of different sizes, in terms of capability and physical dimensions.
                        In the end, servers at an abstract level are simply the hardware that powers the cloud. Large installations of servers are called a data centre.
                        These data centres are located all over the world, in different geographic and political regions. The cloud and its services running on servers, power almost everything in the digital world. 
                        Making possible the social media, entertainment, financial, collaborative work and learning environments as well as enabling scientific pursuits and almost anything else you can imagine.

            <h3>Reasons for the Cloud</h3>
            <div>
                <p><span class="subheading">Why do we have the cloud?</span><br/>
                    The advantages of cloud computing are the leveraging of datacentres, using the economies of scale to provide concentrated centres of computing, storage and connectivity capabilities. 
                    Usually it is in areas of stable political and governmental control.</p>
                <p>The cost of investment for these sites, and the power demands needed, require stability in the regarding politics and infrastructure such as power stations. Another important aspect is the protection of the data. 
                    Whether it be from physical attacks, such terrorism or vigilante attacks. Or cyber-attacks, access to the data from technological espionage and hacking. 
                    Cloud providers invest heavily on privacy and security to secure the data and services they provide. This allows individuals and businesses to trust in the operation of the cloud provider. </p>
                <p>There are many uses of the cloud to provide a wide range of services.
                    One such example is in the financial sector, and for those that use credit and debit cards. 
                    Take the EFTPOS (Electronic Fund Transfer Point Of Sale) machine. 
                    Every time you use this service, the card reading device needs to identify the card details. Send the identification to the corresponding financial institution and calculate if you have enough money in your account, along with any other restrictions in place. 
                    With a beep in a fraction of a second, you and the storekeeper have an acknowledgement that you have paid. 
                    And in the background, the monetary value has also instantly been transferred to the shop’s bank account. </p>
                <p>Another reason for the cloud is to use the economies of scale to more efficiently purchase the storage and servers and networking equipment to be made available for businesses to use. 
                    This is compares to each business purchasing and outlaying the investment required to provide its own onsite server resources and the technical skill to manage it.
                    Because cloud installations can house thousands of business’s data. There is the requirement for onsite security to protect espionage and onsite hacking. 
                    Generally, individual businesses do not have the ability to secure their data in this fashion.</p>
                <p>The advantages of cloud computing are not limited to replacing large and powerful servers. 
                    One example of utilising the cloud is to empower small, lightweight devices with the capability of massive amounts of processing power.  
                    Think about the GPS navigation on your phone. 
                    Or the weather forecast analysis that is fed to your device. 
                    Or having the world’s knowledge at your fingertips. </p>

                <p><span class="subheading">Who provides the cloud?</span><br/>
                    Several cloud providers exist today. Some broadly share the same wide-ranging set of features and have datacentre locations globally. 
                    One of the two main vendors are Amazon with Amazon Web Services, abbreviated to AWS, and Microsoft Azure. 
                    Some service specific types specialise in online storage ie. iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox etc. Some of these providers have hundreds of millions of users.
                    Some provide online game playing streaming. This includes Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, Sony PlayStation Now.

                <p><span class="subheading">What are the disadvantages of the cloud?</span><br/>
                    There are several disadvantages and some of the main points are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="subheading">Security</span> - Even with the investment in physical security and cyber attacks, there are still vulnerabilities in any system. Not least of those that are connected to the internet. And for the physical data centre, it is a prime target for those 
                            that want to disrupt large amounts of businesses. </li>
                        <li><span class="subheading">Cost</span> - Although the costs of using a cloud provider reduces capital expenditure significantly. The nature of operational expenditure may mean some businesses end up 
                            paying more for server resources in the long term. </li>
                        <li><span class="subheading">connectivity</span> - Depending on an online platform means that you need fast, reliable internet connectivity to continue accessing it. While there are improvements being made continually to improve the pipeline, some regions, and some countries have more 
                            capable internet connections to rely on. </li>  
                    </ul>
