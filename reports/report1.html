                        A cloud is a service, running on servers, that is accessed via a connection to the internet or a
                        private network. Therefore, cloud services can be either accessed by anyone publicly, or in
                        certain situations, it can be restricted in a more secure private cloud network. Depending on
                        what the service requires. There are many multiple providers of cloud services, such as Amazon
                        Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Dropbox etc. There are companies that have embraced
                        the cloud and have benefited from the online trade that it offers. Having an additional platform
                        to sell their products allows them to reach to a wider audience. Examples are video streaming
                        services like Disney+, news media such as Sydney Morning Herald, retail stores such as Myer and
                        educational institutions such as the RMIT Online Courses. There are some companies have appeared
                        with the opportunities that the cloud provides that have an cloud only presence. These include
                        video streaming services like Netflix, music streaming provided by Spotify, transportation with
                        Uber, AirBnB with accommodation and the list goes on. According to report by the International
                        Data Group, 69% of businesses are using cloud technology and a further 18% plan to implement
                        cloud solutions in the future. The cloud’s reach is profound and has changed industry and the
                        way we live.

                        The services available from the cloud may be the serving of information, storage or
                        computational /analysis services and often a combination of all three. It could be the website
                        data that is provided from a cloud provider to you. This is also known
                        as web traffic. It could also be other media such as audio, images or video. Computationally,
                        the cloud provider may use their analysis to provide interactive websites, host
                        web applications or provide the capability to analyse large sets data. The last of which is also
                        coined “big data”. The cloud facilitates the increased use of insightful data analysis across
                        almost every industry. One example of the cloud providing extreme processing capability, was for
                        the calculation of Pi to 100,000,000,000,000 digits. This was performed by a Google research
                        team that used the Google Cloud service to achieve the feat. Even with the cloud processing
                        capability of Google, it still took almost 158 days to complete. And it required the use of 515
                        terabytes of storage.

                        “A cloud server is a pooled, centralized server resource that is hosted and delivered over a
                        network—typically the Internet—and accessed on demand by multiple users. Cloud servers can
                        perform all the same functions of a traditional physical server, delivering processing power,
                        storage and applications.” Cloud servers can range in size, in terms of capability and physical
                        dimensions. At an abstract level they are simply the hardware that powers the cloud. Large
                        installations of servers are called a data centre. These data centres are located all over the
                        world, in different geographic and political regions.

                <p><span class="subheading">Advantages of the cloud?</span><br />
                    The advantages of cloud computing are the leveraging of datacentres, using the economies of scale to
                    provide concentrated centres of computing, storage and connectivity capabilities. </p>
                <p>It allows businesses to avoid capital expenditure CAPEX if they were to purchase servers, and instead
                    use the cloud service as an operation expenditure OPEX. </p>
                <p>This allows the flexibility of provisioning cloud services according to the needs of the businesses
                    at any time. And not be limited by static server capability – if the business had to purchase the
                    infrastructure itself. </p>
                <p>It also allows the expertise of managing the technology to be situated and managed within the
                    datacentres and not within each organisation. </p>
                <p>The advantages of cloud computing are not limited to replacing large and powerful servers.
                    One example of utilising the cloud is to empower small, lightweight devices with the capability of
                    massive amounts of processing power. </p>
                <p> Some examples include the GPS navigation application on your phone. Or the weather forecast analysis
                    that is fed to your device. Or having the world’s knowledge at your fingertips.

                <p><span class="subheading">Who provides the cloud?</span><br />
                    There are several providers of cloud infrastructure. Two of the largest in 2022 are Amazon Web
                    Services, AWS at 38.9% market share, and Microsoft Azure with 21.1%. Some cloud service providers
                    provide online storage services such as iCloud, Google Drive and Dropbox.
                    These providers have hundreds of millions of users.

                <p><span class="subheading">What are the disadvantages of the cloud?</span><br />
                    There are several disadvantages:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="subheading">Security</span> - Even with the investment in physical and network
                        security, there are still vulnerabilities in any system. Terrorism may target data centres
                        physically. While hackers may attack cloud providers, services and the people that rely on them.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="subheading">Cost</span> - For the customer, though the costs of using a cloud
                        provider reduces CAPEX significantly. The nature of OPEX may mean some businesses end up paying
                        more for server resources in the long term.
                        For the cloud provider, there is a high cost of setting up datacentres.</li>
                    <li><span class="subheading">connectivity</span> - Depending on an online platform means that you
                        need fast, reliable internet connectivity to continue using it effectively.
                        While there are improvements being made continually to improve internet connectivity globally,
                        some regions may not have a capable internet connection to rely on. </li>

            <p><span class="subheading">What is the impact of the cloud?</span><br />
                There is no doubt that the cloud has impacted industry greatly. It is estimated that in 2021, over 6.25
                billion smartphones are in use globally. Companies that can leverage the reach that the cloud has can
                take advantage of additional methods of trade. Indeed the availability and capability of the cloud has
                created many businesses that are only available through online access. These have often disrupted long
                held ways of doing business in many industries. Music services such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube
                Music for example have encroached and replaced the way we listen to music. Video streaming services such
                as Netflix, Hulu and Youtube have supplanted television and cinemas as the primary avenue of watching
                television shows and movies. We can even play games using online gaming platforms. It has impacted
                almost everything we do. From the way we shop, the way we are entertained, even the way we find love. In
                a 2021 study in the United States, 46% of participants have used online dating platforms. (25 Online
                Dating Statistics & Trends in 2022)

            <p><span class="subheading">What is the future of the cloud? </span><br />
                New technologies are constantly being researched and discovered. Developments in edge computing aims to
                bring the cloud technologies closer to the source. Facilitating speed and reliability. Improvements in
                wearable technology, such as smartwatches and the expected introduction of smart glasses will continue
                to leverage the cloud. To bring technology ever closer to being not just an extension of the human body,
                but a part of it. Further advances in the power and accessibility of the cloud may enable the holy grail
                of all the knowledge and data in the world, to be available to any device, anywhere in the world
                instantaneously
