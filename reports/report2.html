                <p><span class="subheading">Blockchain</span><br />
                    Blockchain is a decentralised ledger or database that stores all the information about the
                    transactions that utilise its technology. The Blockchain is a secure platform that uses Hash,
                    Proof-of-Work, and consensus. <br /><br />
                    <img src="../media/Blockchain.JPG" style="max-width: 75vh;" class="center" />
                    <center><p style="font-size:12px; ">Figure 1: Simply Explained (2017) Screenshot of what is a blockchain<br /><br /> </p></center>
                    Each block contains Data, Hash (a unique code), and the Hash of the block before it. The Hash makes
                    it secure because if someone changes the data within the block, the Hash of that block changes to
                    correlate with the new data. In that case, the next block in the chain throws up the error because
                    its Previous Block is now different. To make this even more secure, Blockchain also has Proof of
                    Work. This Proof of Work is the decentralised part of the Blockchain, where it requires members of a
                    network to verify the integrity of the block.
                </p>
                <p><span class="subheading">Cryptocurrency</span><br />
                    Cryptocurrency is a digital asset with a value built on Blockchain. Cryptocurrency is different to
                    traditional currency. If we look at the table below, we see a few differences.

                <p>Cryptocurrency uses this state-of-the-art technology called Blockchain. As you can see above, the
                    benefits and security Blockchain provides. The first Cryptocurrency that almost everyone has heard
                    of is the coin Bitcoin. The original cryptocurrency coin ‘Bitcoin’ was created by an unknown person
                    or group called Satoshi Nakamoto, which explains why a subunit of Bitcoin is called Satoshi. One
                    million Satoshi equals one bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies were developed to give users complete control
                    over their finances and away from the power of governments and banks.<br /><br />
                    The current number of cryptocurrencies is over 10,000, with each coin having its benefits and uses.
                    The value of these cryptocurrencies is decided by supply and demand. You can see below the process
                    when someone purchases or sends coins to another user.

                    <span style="text-decoration: underline">DeFi</span>: Decentralised Financial Applications are a
                    current trend that uses Cryptocurrency and
                    blockchain technology to provide financial products (loans, trading, etc.). Their goal is to provide
                    an alternative to traditional services by utilising the peer-to-peer technology of Blockchain. Defi
                    came about after the global financial crisis when confidence in the FIAT financial institutes
                    started declining.
                </p>
                <p><span class="subheading">What does the future hold?</span><br />
                    The continual development of the Blockchain in the Cryptocurrency scene will pave the way for more
                    possible products in Finance, Business, Legal, Real estate, Logistics and Healthcare. There are
                    already applications on the Blockchain delving into these areas.<br /><br />
                    As this technology continues to grow, there will always be that element of society that will want to
                    abuse or use this technology for nefarious ventures. While it would be this threat that would cause
                    people to attempt to block this development, Blockchain technology has potential for huge
                    improvements in the future.
                </p>
                <p><span class="subheading">What will this technology likely impact?</span><br />
                    Blockchain technology will likely impact industries across the board. For example, in the Finance
                    sector, it will open the availability to borrowing money, investing and earning existing
                    cryptocurrencies a user owns. As a result, traditional financial institutes have been monitoring
                    Cryptocurrency. <br /><br />
                    Unfortunately, being in a decentralised environment, Cryptocurrency has more risks than traditional
                    financial institutes. Some of these risks include no buyer protection, the value of the coin being
                    unstable, and as with all cryptocurrency dealings, you must use a digital wallet. If you lose the
                    unique code, there is no central entity that can assist you in recovering the said lost code, and in
                    turn, you lose whatever digital asset was associated with that wallet. As Blockchain technology
                    develops and matures, it will be more secure as they mitigate flaws and other issues. <br /><br />
                    Now, the people who would be most affected are the investors who back these projects and the people
                    involved in developing these projects. In the future, as this technology develops, it will allow
                    streamlining of the different processes, which could impact existing jobs, like real estate agencies
                    and Mortgage lenders. But on the other hand, they could create more jobs; again, the financial
                    sector is a prime example, as the Blockchain will allow lending and investing to users whom
                    traditional institutes would typically deny these services.

                <p><span class="subheading">How will this affect me, my family, and my friends?</span><br />
                    I have been dabbling in cryptocurrency for the last five years and have seen this phenomenon of
                    “Cryptocurrency” rise and fall. However, it has slowly become accepted in the broader community as
                    its application has become more investigated. In my daily life, I do not see any evidence of change,
                    but behind the scenes are things like making personal digital Identification more secure and more
                    widely available. As this technology develops, we see more applications built around Blockchain
                    technology. 
                </p>
                <p><span class="subheading">What will be different in the future?</span><br />
                    As someone with an extensive medical history, I am interested in watching the developing medical
                    applications and seeing how they would make life easier for individuals and medical providers. With
                    patient privacy a primary concern, it is easy to understand the benefits of blockchain technology
                    covering this concern.
                </p>
                <p><span class="subheading">How might this affect members of your family or friends?</span><br />
                    For ethically minded friends and family, blockchain technology is changing the supply chain process,
                    tracking goods at every step, from harvesting, processing, and manufacturing to the consumer at the
                    other end. This tracking encourages more confidence in the buyer, knowing that everyone received a
                    fair wage and one exploited throughout the process.
