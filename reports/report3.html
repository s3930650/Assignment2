                <p><span class="subheading">What is Cybersecurity?</span><br />
                    Cybersecurity is the term used to describe the protection and security of IT systems all the way
                    from the hardware to the software and data stored on them,
                    from digital attacks. Cybersecurity not only covers the digital protection of these systems, but
                    also the physical protection. <br />
                    For example, a large business or data centre will have physical and digital security measures in
                    place to prevent unauthorised access to IT systems such as servers,
                    networking equipment or workstations. These security measures will depend on the size and nature of
                    what is being protected. They can range from something as simple as using passwords and having
                    equipment in a locked room, to something as complex as a secure fenced facility with 24hr
                    surveillance, biometric locks, and data encryption. <br />
                    Not only can a data breach be dangerous, but it can also be very expensive, costing on average $4.35
                    million USD globally in 2022. This is why cybersecurity is such an important aspect of the IT
                    industry.

                <p><span class="subheading">What is the state of the art of this new technology and what can be done
                        now?</span><br />
                    As we move more of our daily lives online and increase our reliance on the internet, cybercrime has
                    grown and become a major threat. Cybercrime has been around since the dawn of the internet but its
                    only in recent years that it has gained more attention from the general public. Some of the
                    technology being used in cybersecurity today are things like artificial intelligence, behavioral
                    analytics, and blockchain cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:lighter; text-decoration: underline;">Artificial Intelligence</span><br />
                    Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been used in a variety of applications. In cybersecurity AI is
                    being used to help IT security personnel identify potential vulnerabilities in their systems and to
                    increase the speed at which they can be detected and stopped. This is done using AI technologies
                    such as machine learning and natural language processing. Machine learning and natural language
                    processing work together to help the AI analyse and learn from the data it collects or is given. By
                    giving the AI data on previous cyber attacks it can identify patterns or irregularities that may
                    indicate a cyber-attack. The AI can monitor and analyse the network in real time so it can learn the
                    normal actions that take place. This way when something out of the ordinary occurs the AI can
                    quickly and easily identify it and act before it becomes a threat.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:lighter; text-decoration: underline;">Behavioural Anayltics</span><br />
                    Behavioural analytics is a way of analysing the trends, patterns and behaviours of a user on a
                    platform, such as a website or game (Wikipedia 2022). Behavioural analytics is used a lot in
                    e-commerce, but it also can also be used in cybersecurity. By analysing the typical types of things
                    a user does, a profile can be generated that can identify when something falls outside of the usual
                    or expected behaviour. Behavioural analytics is usually used in conjunction with AI or other
                    automated systems so that when such an event occurs, the system can act accordingly to prevent the
                    threat. It could be as simple as prompting a user to verify they are not a robot using something
                    like a CAPTCHA, or perhaps require further identification via two-factor authentication. It could
                    also block access entirely.

                            Cybersecurity</span><br />
                        The blockchain is essentially a new type of information technology combining cryptography with
                        distributed computing while being a completely decentralised system, meaning that it is not
                        controlled by a single governing body or corporation. It works by having a network of computers
                        work together to essentially create a shared and secure database. The database is built on a
                        chain of blocks, each of which is an encrypted piece of data that is given a unique identifier
                        called a hash. Before anything can be added to the chain, an algorithm is used to ensure all the
                        computers on the network agree to the change so that no single computer can modify it. All the
                        blocks are connected in chronological order and their hash value is dependant of the previous
                        block. This means that a block cannot be deleted or modified without all subsequent blocks being
                        changed as well. This method makes it nearly impossible to tamper with the data.

                <p><span class="subheading">What technological or other developments make this possible?</span><br />
                    Advancements in the cloud computing sector have helped improve cybersecurity. Having access to such
                    a vast compute resource has allowed companies to develop more advanced AI systems and analyse large
                    amounts of data much faster. The blockchain is often just associated with cryptocurrency, but as
                    more attention is drawn to its security features, we will likely see it adopted into more data
                    storage scenarios.

            <div>
                <p><span class="subheading">What is the potential impact of this development?</span><br />
                    The use of AI and behavioural analytics has brought up the topic of privacy violation. Having
                    computer systems that can gather a userâ€™s information just by analysing their usage has the
                    potential to cause people to be hesitant to use them. We already see similar things right now when
                    it comes to people using cash or card to pay for something.
                </p>
                <p><span class="subheading">What is likely to change?</span><br />
                    These technologies are going to be here to stay, the benefits they offer outweigh the risks. There
                    are already laws regarding privacy, so we will likely these extended to include what data can be
                    collected and how this data is managed in relation to cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p><span class="subheading">Which people will be most affected and how?</span><br />
                    These advancements in cybersecurity are going to benefit everyone. While big businesses are going to
                    be affected greatly, it is everyday users of their services that will see it the most. For example,
                    having a more secure banking service is going to provide not only piece of mind but also save
                    customers money. The use of AI and behavioural analytics can help detect potential fraud activity
                    and stop transactions before they cost people money. This is going to be of great benefit to people
                    that are not as tech savvy when it comes to identifying fake websites and making purchases online.
                </p>
                <p><span class="suheading">Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs or
                        technologies?</span><br />
                    The advancements in cybersecurity have the potential to both create new jobs and make other jobs
                    obsolete. The use of AI will help in developing new systems and applications which may impact some
                    roles. However, with the need for cybersecurity growing it will require more people, so we are
                    likely to see more jobs being created than jobs lost.

                <p><span class="subheading">In your daily life, how will this affect you?</span><br />
                    These cybersecurity technologies would add additional security to our daily lives. While many of us
                    are quite careful when it comes to online payments and internet security, it would not be hard for
                    an accidental slip up to bring this all undone. By having our information stored securely using the
                    blockchain, and using AI and behavioural analytics to identify when something out of the ordinary
                    occurs we can minimise the impact a cybersecurity attack can have.
                </p>
                <p><span class="subheading">What will be different for you></span><br />
                    While nothing may change in how we do things from day to day, the processes that go on behind the
                    scenes will help to ensure our daily lives are more secure. Having our banking institutions adopt
                    more advanced cybersecurity technologies will ensure that our financial losses from cyber attacks
                    are minimised. Governments and other organisations that have all sorts of personal information about
                    us using more secure storage technologies will help prevent data theft. All of these things will
                    benefit us and reduce our chance of becoming victim to cyber crime.

                <p><span class="subheading">How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</span><br />
                    Generally speaking, older family members are not great when it comes to technology and
                    cybersecurity. It would be very easy for someone to catch them out with a phishing email or
                    illegitimate website pretending to be one they would trust. The use of AI or behavioural analytics
                    would help to protect them as it would identify the suspicious activity before they were able to do
                    anything to compromise their security.
