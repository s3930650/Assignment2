            <p><span class="subheading">What is an autonomous vehicle?</span><br />
                An autonomous vehicle is one that can drive itself from point A to point B in autopilot mode using
                various in vehicle technologies and sensors, including adaptive cruise control, active steering,
                anti-lock braking systems, GPS navigation technology, lasers, radars and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p><span class="subheading">What is the state of the art of this new technology and what can be down
                    now?</span><br /></p>
            <ul class="av-list">
                <li><span>Level 1 - Driver Assistance</span>: At this level, the automated systems start to take control
                    of the
                    vehicle in specific situations, but do not fully take over. An example is adaptive cruised control
                    which controls acceleration and breaking, typically in highway driving. Depending on the
                    functionality drivers are able to take their feet off the pedals.</li>
                <li><span>Level 2 - Partial Automation</span>: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are a key
                    feature of level 2. These cars can brake automatically, accelerate and take over steering. However,
                    theses ae not fully autonomous cars a driver continues to remain in control and must always pay
                    attention to traffic.</li>
                <li><span>Level 3 - Conditional Automation</span>: At level 3, divers can disengage from the act of
                    driving but only in specific situations. Conditions could be limited to certain vehicle speeds, road
                    types and weather conditions. But because drivers can apply their focus to some other tasks such as
                    looking at a phone or newspaper this is generally considered the initial entry point to autonomous
                    driving. Never less the driver is expected to take over when the system requests it. For example,
                    features such as traffic jam pilot mean that drivers can sit back and relax while the system handles
                    it all, acceleration, steering and breaking in stop and go traffic, the vehicle sends an alert to
                    the driver to regain control when the vehicle gets through the traffic jam and vehicle speed
                    increases. </li>
                <li><span>Level 4 - High Automation</span>: At this level the vehicle’s autonomous driving system is
                    fully capable of monitoring the driving environment and handling all driving functions for routine
                    routes and conditions defined within its operational design domain (ODD). The vehicle mat alert the
                    driver that is reaching its operational limits if there is say an environmental condition that
                    requires a human in control such as heavy snow. If the driver doesn’t respond it will secure the
                    vehicle automatically.</li>
                <li><span>Level 5 - Full Automation</span>: Level 5 capable vehicles are fully autonomous. No diver is
                    required behind the wheel at all. In fact, level 5 vehicles might not even have a steering wheel or
                    gas/brake pedals. These vehicles could have smart cabins so that passengers can issue voice commands
                    to choose a destination or set cabin conditions such as temperature or choice of media.</li>

                <p><span class="subheading">Let us break this process down into three main components:</span><br />
                    We are building autonomous vehicles to drive themselves but we what them to drive like human drivers
                    would drive. This means we need o proved these vehicles with sensory functions, cognitive functions,
                    memory, logical thinking decision-making, execute capabilities the humans use to drive vehicles.
                    In-vehicle data collection and communication systems
                </p>
                <ul class="av-list">
                    <li><span>Component 1 - In-Vehicle data collection & communication systems:</span><br />
                        Autonomous vehicles are fitted with numerous sensors, radars and cameras to generate massive
                        amounts of environmental data all of these form the digital sensorium through which the
                        autonomous vehicle can see, hear and see the road, other vehicles and every other object on/near
                        the road just like a human driver would pay attention to the road while driving.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Component 2 - Autonomous driving platform (cloud):</span><br />
                        The autonomous driving platform which is in the cloud contains an intelligent agent which makes
                        use of AI algorithms to make meaningful decisions. It acts as the control policy or the brain of
                        the autonomous vehicle. This intelligent agent is also connected to a database to which acts as
                        a memory where past driving experiences are stored.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Component 3 - AI-based function in autonomous vehicles:</span><br />
                        Based on the decisions made by the intelligent agent. The autonomous vehicle can detect objects
                        on the road, manoeuvre through traffic without human intervention and gets to the destination
                        safely.
                    </li> 
                </ul>
                <p>This data loop called perception action cycle takes place repetitively, the more the number of
                    perception action cycles take place, that more intelligent the intelligent agent becomes resulting
                    in higher accuracy of making decisions especially in complex driving situations. Artificial
                    intelligence especially neural networks and deep learning have become an absolute necessity to make
                    autonomous vehicles function properly and safely.</p>
