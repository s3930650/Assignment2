        <h1>Tools</h1>
        <div>
            <p>In this assessment, we have used a number of tools to develop, collaborate, and communicate on the
                project.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="tool-item">
                    <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank"
                        style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none;">Discord</a>: An instant messaging platform with
                    private chats and community servers.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We used Discord to assembled our group, find each other on a community server setup by
                            another student for the unit.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="tool-item">
                    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams" target="_blank"
                        style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none;">Microsoft Teams</a>: A collaboration
                    environment allowing users to share thoughts and files.
                    <ul>
                        <li>We used MS Teams to have weekly meetings and discuss the tasks at hand</li>
                        <li>Shared files and feedback using the programs file sharing functionality</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="tool-item">
                    <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank"
                        style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none;">GitHub</a>: A code hosting platform for version
                    control and collaboration.
                    <ul>
                        <li>We used GitHub to keep the website code under version control, and to allow all members to
                            have access.</li>
                        <li>We also used the 'Pages' functionality of GitHub to host our project as a website.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="tool-item">
                    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/word" target="_blank"
                        style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none;">Microsoft Word</a>: A word processing software.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We used Microsoft Word to develop our reports and research.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="tool-item">
                    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
                        style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none;">Visual Studio Code</a>: A source-code editor
                    for use with a variety of programming languages.
                    <ul>
                        <li>We used Visual Studio Code to develop our websites HTML and CSS</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Primarily, we have used a GitHub repo (<a
                    href="https://github.com/s3930650/Assignment2">https://github.com/s3930650/Assignment2</a>) to edit
                our website as sections of the project have been completed. Primarily Leigh has looked after this, but
                everyone in the group has had access and have edited sections when needed. Due to this, commits are a
                mix of small edits correcting spelling mistakes or style changes, and also large commits with HTML
                documents fleshed out with the content of our work.
                When it came to editing and sharing our work, we utilised Microsoft Teams file sharing as it provided
                another central place to read and write documents, and unlike GitHub you could see live changes within
                the editor. This proved useful in multiple cases, such as in meetings when we could discuss edits whilst
                making them, and also during our interview with a professional as we could strike out questions he had
                answered to avoid asking them twice.
